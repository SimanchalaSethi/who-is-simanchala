      content: `<p>As a Backend Team Lead, managing code effectively is crucial to our success. In this blog, Iâ€™ll share our meticulously designed Git workflow that ensures seamless integration and delivery.</p>
                <p><strong>Branching Strategy:</strong></p>
                <p>- <strong>Main Branches:</strong> We operate with three main branches - dev, rel, and main.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Team members pull from the dev branch and create feature branches based on the specific APIs they are working on.</p>
                <p><strong>Development Process:</strong></p>
                <p>- <strong>Code Writing:</strong> Once the development is completed, the code is pushed to their respective feature branches.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Code Review:</strong> I review the code, providing feedback and merging it into the dev branch if all checks pass. Declines are made if issues are found.</p>
                <p><strong>Testing Phase:</strong></p>
                <p>- <strong>API Testing:</strong> Post-merge, our testing team rigorously tests the APIs. Any bugs found are fixed by pulling the latest dev branch code, fixing the bugs, and pushing the changes.</p>
                <p><strong>Approval Stages:</strong></p>
                <p>- <strong>Integration:</strong> Once testing is successful, I merge the changes into the rel branch where frontend and backend are integrated.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Client Approval:</strong> Our testing team validates the integrated application and seeks client approval.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Final Merge:</strong> Upon client approval, the code is merged into the main branch, marking it ready for production.</p>`,
